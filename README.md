# AI-for-Medicine-Notes

AI for Medicine is an intermediate specialization track offered by deeplearning.ai on Coursera. The course is taught by Pranav Rajpurkar.
[Course Link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-for-medicine?)

This specialization has three courses in it :
1. [AI for Medical Diagnosis](https://github.com/ReboreExplore/AI-for-Medicine_Notes/blob/main/AI_for_Medicine_course1.pdf)
2. AI for Medical Prognosis. (not yet completed)
3. AI For Medical Treatment. (not yet completed)

The notes are taken while doing the course. The digitally "handwritten" written notes are made using [Xournal](https://xournalpp.github.io/).

I will add a discussion on the assignments as well later.

*NOTE: This notes in no way serves as a replacement for the course however should only be used for revision after doing the course. Doing the course in coursera on our own is an experience in itself*
